# TokenReplay
This is a Java implementation of the token replay conformance checking algorithm.

There are two branches that extend the implementation. The "extended" branch includes process enhancement by adding the execution times of Petri net transitions. The "python-toolchain" branch groups a set of python scripts to automatically execute the extended version of the algorithm.
